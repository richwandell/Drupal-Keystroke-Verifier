# Drupal Keystroke Verifier

The Drupal Keystroke Verifier Module (KSV) is an application of the approach taken from the work of Daniele Gunetti and Claudia Picardi to calculate the A and R values for two typing samples of free text. The module is used to verify the authenticity of the user that is typing on a keyboard against the user that is logged into a Drupal web site. Drupal was chosen as a platform for this project based on the lack of an existing module and the clear application of such an approach into the workflow of an editorial department. I believe that this could be useful to provide a level of soft security that does not exist today in most editorial departments. Flagging an article for review based on the keystrokes of the editor could be useful for catching impersonators attempting to publish under the account of an editor. In admin pages that are sensitive areas, the KSV could be used to log out a user or flag an account for review when the user has typed a sample of text that cannot be verified.
